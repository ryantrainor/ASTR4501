# ASTR4501 - Astroinformática
Material for AST4501 (Astroinformática) at Universidad de Chile, Santiago.

These materials were adapted from previous materials by [Francisco Förster](https://github.com/fforster/AS4501) and [Valentino González](https://github.com/thevalentino/AS450-astroinformatica) for the ASTR4501 course taught during the 2024B (Primavera) semester.

The notebooks are designed to be run using standard python libraries as well as the astroML library. To set up a conda environment including the necessary libraries, you can use the yaml file (`astroML.yaml`) in the config directory:

```
conda env create -f astroML.yaml
conda activate astroML
```
